## Assignment details

### Part 1 (45 Pts)
1 - 142.93.136.81
2 - One possible took that the hackers are attempting to use and implement is some form of command line injection through repeated guesses. The constant sending of messages of the same size makes it seem that the user is trying various inputs on the server to tryand gain access. This could be done using sockets in python as we did in a previous hw. 
3 - 159.203.113.181, location - 101 Ave of the Americas, 10th Floor New York 
4 - 20 
5 - find_me.jpeg, type = jpeg, not familiar 
6 - greetz.fpff 
7- One possible idea to prevent this type of attack from happening is to implement a system where if a specific IP address sends X many packets to the server in a certain time frame, the IP address gets white listed and is unable to access the server for a certain amount of time.
