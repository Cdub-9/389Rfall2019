## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the ELMS assignment.

### Part 2 (75 pts)
For the given situation, I would first tell my boss. Since he/she is the one who has put me on the project and expects my assessment of the situation, it would make sense to inform him/her first. If I were to tell him/her, and they would do nothing about it, or go forward with production without fixing the safety concerns, I would then possibly reach out to a consumer watchdog, and then the public. Depending on the severity of the security issue and who it affects would affect my judgment and decision about bringing this decision to the public/watchdog. If the security issue was something that was only related to the company and could only hurt the company, I would not take the extra steps needed to alert the public.

Within the situation, if the company heard my concerns for the safety system, and are still unwilling to postpone the ECU's release I would just inform some public media company about the situation. I would tell them about my concerns on the system and the possible consequences that could occur onto the general public. This is probably as far as I would go, its hard to really go further than this without getting any possible consequences that come back on yourself. You have informed the company as well as the public, which are both parties that are being affected by the security issue.

I believe I am only responsible for harm that occurs if I tell no one at all. I believe that if I inform my boss/person in charge of manufacturing the ECU, and he/she does nothing with the information that I give to him, then the responsibility lays with him. I would only be held accountable for the harm done if I was fully aware of the issues present and made an active decision to not tell anyone about the issues or how to fix them.
